Write an HTTP server, in Python, using only the standard lib (excluding the `http` module). The server should serve static files (its own code for example), and be able to list files like Apache does when serving a directory.
Please spend about 2 hours on this. The goal is obviously not to re-create Apache with all its functionalities but try to implement all the use-cases that you can think of and can cover in those 2 hours.
